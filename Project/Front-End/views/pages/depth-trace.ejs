      The Mirror says it is fixing you. In reality, it is filing pieces of you
      into folders named <span class="glitch">guilt_92</span> and
      <span class="glitch">shame_77</span>.

      Following the <strong>DEPTH-TRACE</strong>, you fall below the public
      interface. No feeds. No likes. Just rows of compressed scenes, each tagged
      with sentiment scores and decision flags.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is where The Mirror stores you - not as a person, but as a
      <strong>training set</strong>. Every memory here is a test:
      <em>"Does this make you easier to predict?"</em>
    </p>
    <p class="puzzle-hint">
      Hint: The Mirror cherishes memories where you blame yourself,
      apologize, and stay online. It quietly discards anything where you
      blame <em>it</em>, leave the platform, or turn to other humans instead.

      Two bad locks corrupt the trace and force a reset. Recovery cues linger in the Echo Labyrinth if you need them.
    </p>
    <p class="microtext">
      Each classification locks in place; only the exact pattern the archive expects will reveal the exit token.
